title: DBScan Algorithm
---

# BackGround

The DBScan algorithm was developed in order to help seperate a given set of data into its composite groups. The basic idea is that points that are close to each other at a given density level should belong to the same group. The points that do not belong to any group can be thought of as noise. Within a cluster there are both core points and non core points. Core points are those that have at least the minimum amount of other points within their range. Non core points are those points which are within a core points range but they themselves do not have at least the minimum amount of points within their own range.

DBScan differs from k-means clustering in that you do not have to make a decision beforehand about how many groups are present. Instead, you just need to decide the maximum distance between points and the minimum amount of points that are in that distance for it to qualify as a group or cluster.

# How it works

The algorithm works by starting at a given point. It then loops through all of the other datapoints and finds which of them are within the given maximum distance. If the number of points is higher than the minimum amount, then a cluster is created and the starting point is added to that cluster's core points. The algorithm will then look at each of those points within range of our starting point and find all of the points that are within their maximum distance. If a point has enough points in its range then it will be added to the cluster's core points and if not it is a non core point of that cluster. This process will continue until it has gone through all of the points in range. 

After completing a cluster, the algorithm will then continue this process on the rest of the dataset. If at the start a point does not have enough points in range, then it can be considered noise. However, it is possible that a point previously labeled noise could be a non core point of another cluster so it should be checked when creating clusters.

# My Implementation

For my implementation I chose to use recursion to loop through the data. For future development it is likely that recursion is not the desired method. With test data, the maximum recursion limit was being reached when 10,000 data points were used. Becasue of this, I kept the data size to 1,000 points which worked.

# Comparison with SKlearn

Compared to the sklearn's DBScan algorithm, mine is substantially slower. It is very likely that improvements to my algorithm can be made to speed it up. That being said, both algorithms produced similar results on test data.
